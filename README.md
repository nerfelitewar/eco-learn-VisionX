## Setup Instructions

1. **Supabase Credentials Setup**:
   - Copy `auth-config.example.js` to `auth-config.js`.

     - You can find these in your Supabase project dashboard under Settings > API.
   - Do not commit `auth-config.js` to version control for security reasons.

2. **Running the Application**:
